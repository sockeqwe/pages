In a digital product startup the success of the company depends on teamwork and collaboration across teams and departments. 
This is not unique to startups obviously but for startups in particular it is important to move fast. 
In 2019 my team and stakeholders asked ourselves one question: is engineering the bottleneck?

## Historical context

In 2019 I have been asked to join a new team dedicated to monetization and growth as Engineering Manager. So I did. 
We owned an area of our app: from registration to onboarding including monetization such as paywalls and payments but also growth (paid advertisement together with our marketing department but also organic growth such as a referral program).
