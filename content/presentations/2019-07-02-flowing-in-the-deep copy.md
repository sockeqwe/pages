The Kotlin team introduced a new type called Flow which looks similar to RxJava’s Observable or Flowable. Have you ever wondered what’s the difference between Flow and RxJava? How does Flow work under the hood? How is it connected to Coroutines? How do you write your own operator? What about Kotlin Coroutine Channels? Backpressure? Coroutine Scopes?

Join this session to get an introduction into Flow followed by a deep dive into the some core aspects of Flow to ultimately feel confident using Flow inside your android app.
